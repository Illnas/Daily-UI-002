Daily UI 002 

Task was to make a credit card checkout form with all the necessary information. Since I am familiar with that type of thing only
from Valorant since I am buying Battlepasses there, I decided to make their form in HTML/CSS. It was kinda easy challenge, problem was that 
I got hooked on 100 JS projects and the only reason I am stopped doing them was that I need to learn more about constructors in JS.

WARNING: Project needs to be viewed on big screen, I did not implement changes for smaller screens (ipads/mobile)! Well, I need to practice github
         and all it's features ;)
